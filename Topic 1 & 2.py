# TEXT PASTED INTO DISCUSSION FORUM FOR WEEKS 1 AND 2
# WEEK 1: My name is Valerie, so the first and last letter of my name (V + E = 22 + 5) give the number 27. The 27th Fibonacci number is 196,418. Not afraid to admit it took me 20+ mins to figure out why I kept re-running the 30th number...I forgot to Save the fib.py after I changed the number before running it again... 

# WEEK 2: 
My surname is Walsh
The first letter W is number 87
The last letter h is number 104

Fibonacci number 191 is 3691087032412706639440686994833808526209

I googled the definition of ord() in order to understand it and found the description from the python.org site:
Given a string of length one, return an integer representing the Unicode code point of the character when the argument is a unicode object, or the value of the byte when the argument is an 8-bit string. For example, ord('a') returns the integer 97 ,ord(u'\u2020') returns 8224 .
Once I understood it i gathered the ord() values for the 1st and last letter of my surname from the ASCII table and matches what is above from the ran script.
W = 87
h = 104
