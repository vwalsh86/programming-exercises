# <em>Weekly Exercises: Programming & Scripting - 52167</em>
# <h3>Higher Diploma in Data Analytics 2018 (GMIT) <br/> Subject: Programming & Scripting | Lecturer: Ian McLoughlin</h3>
## Overview
A repository containing completed exercises for college subject 'Programming and Scripting' at GMIT.
The lecturer for this subject is <a href="https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/">Ian McLoughlin</a>. <br/>
The files that are included within this repository have been uploaded for the purpose of being scored as apart of my Continuous Assessment for this subject.  
I have added <strong>.py</strong> at the end of each file title as this allows Github to recognise and display the files as Python scripts, making them easier to read.
I have created a table (see below) explaining which topic each file is linked to as per exercises set out on the course <a href="https://learnonline.gmit.ie/course/view.php?id=3940">Moodle Page</a>.

WEEKLY TASKS |  FILE TITLE 
------------ | -------------
Exercise 1 & 2 | Fibonacci & Surname
Exercise 3 | Collatz Script
Exercise 4 | Project Euler Problem 5
Exercise 5 | Iris Data Set
Exercise 6 | Factorial Function

## Instructions - How to install the software used:

![Anaconda logo](logo-dark.png)   ![Visual Studio Code logo](vsc.jpg)

Please follow the below steps to download the software which I used to create these files:
- [x] Download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">Visual Studio Code</a>
- [x] Download <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a> {Ensure to select the newest version of Anaconda, which is Python 3.6 version at the time of publishing.} <br/> 
<em>Python itself is a programming language, there are many pieces of software which can be used to access it. For this repository, I have chosen to use Anaconda as instructed by the course lecturer. Please note: the download file is a large file, >500MB.</em> <br/>
- [x] Once downloaded, run both the exe files and follow to step-by-step guide to complete install.
- [x] Copy and paste the file content into Visual Studio Code
- [x] Open the Integrated Terminal and to run the file type <strong>python filename.py</strong>

# Topics 

## Fibonacci & Surname
<strong>Topic 1: Basics of Programming</strong> <br/>
<strong>Topic 2: State, variables and statements</strong> <br/>
<em>Completed exercises for weeks 1 & 2, including my comment from the Discussion Forum for these tasks.</em>

## Collatz Script
<strong>Topic 3: Conditions, loops and flow control</strong> <br/>
<em>Write a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. </em>

## Project Euler Problem 5
<strong>Topic 4: Lists</strong>  <br/>
<em>Write a Python program using for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20.</em>

## Iris Data Set
<strong>Topic 5: Input and output</strong> <br/>
<em>Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format.</em> 

## Factorial Function
<strong>Topic 6: Functions</strong> <br/>
<em> Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.</em>
